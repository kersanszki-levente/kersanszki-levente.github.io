I don't have a grandiose plan for this site. When I say this I mean that there is no overarching big goal for it. It's not even a project. It exists purely to satisfy my need. My need to share what I have learned or things I have found out that may be of use to others, especially to my colleagues. In my head it feels much better to share my thoughs or experiments in greater detail than what can be conveyed in a chat conversation.

I also want to get better at writing and what better way to do that than documenting my findings. That is going to be the purpose of this site. Again, there is no topic to tie everything together. Every post will be based on my current interest and I intend to keep it that way. That's it for now. Thanks for dropping by!
